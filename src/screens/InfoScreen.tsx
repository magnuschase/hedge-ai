					Object recognition is a key technology, that is likely to play an increasingly important role in the future world.
					That's why we decided to create an app that can help people to identify objects around them.

				<RegularText
					style={[
						tailwind('font-light text-lg mb-4 text-slate-400')

				>
					We're not creating the next Google Lens, but we're trying to make your phone a little bit smarter.
					Out of the box we provide you with a few basic models, that recognise letters from ASL, general objects, and our favorite, hedgehogs ðŸ¦”
				</RegularText>
				<RegularText
					style={[
						tailwind('text-lg mb-4 text-slate-500')

				>
					But the best part is that you can upload your own model to use in the app. Just follow the instructions on the 'Custom' screen.

					We hope you'll enjoy using our app as much as we enjoyed creating it.
